This is my solution to our team's 01/14/2022 learning challenge! The challenge
is based on Exercise 54 in Brian P. Hagan's "Exercises for Programmers" book by
PragProg.

## Development & Testing

- Run the application with `mix run --no-halt`, or within an iex session
  `iex -S mix`. You can visit the application at http://localhost:4001/.
- Run tests via `mix test`.
